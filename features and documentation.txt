 Launch video file to play film from the app - DONE
    This is done. I am rendering a template to play the movie file using an html 5 video canvas. To play the movie
     I am using a javascript workaround that uses a form input tag to locate the specific movie file on the file system. The video tag
     'src' attribute will not because of system security render a file on mouse click which is what I desire the application to ultimately do. The 'srd' attribute expects  an http context.
     So perhaps a future feature will be to implement an http web server that serves up the movie file.

Required naming for movie files.
file name needs to be in following format:
Title of movie + space(year).extension
We support .mp4, .mkv and .avi extensions

Configuration
Set your path locations for movie scraping for flat folder(no subfolders) and for layout structures that use subfolders. Presently no TV series capability.
