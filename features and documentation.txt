 Launch video file to play film from the app - DONE
    This is done. I am rendering a template to play the movie file using an html 5 video canvas. To play the movie
     I am using a javascript workaround that utilizes a form input tag to locate the specific movie file on the file system. The video tag
     src attribute will not for security purposes locate a file source. It expects an http source. So perhaps a future feature could be to
     implement an http web server that serves up the movie files.

Required naming for movie files.
file name needs to be in following format:
Title of movie + space(year).extension
We support .mp4, .mkv and .avi extensions

Configuration
Set your path locations for movie scraping for flat folder(no subfolders) and for layout structures that use subfolders. Presently no TV series capability.
